rem Explorer-double-click launcher for ops/remove-users.sh. Mirror of
rem create-users.bat: the .sh is the real entry; this .bat exists so an
rem operator can run the remove-users flow without first opening a WSL
rem terminal. The .sh dispatches the Common-Ansible substrate bridge,
rem which re-execs itself into the WSL controller, so launching through
rem Git Bash here is sufficient.
rem
rem _find-bash.bat from Common-Automation locates Git Bash robustly and
rem sets %BASH%; reused rather than reimplemented (the lookup probes
rem several install layouts and has its own rationale comments).
rem Common-Automation is expected as a sibling checkout under the same
rem parent directory as this repo.
rem
rem We hold the window open here with `pause` so Explorer-click users
rem can read the play recap; the .sh itself stays quiet on exit.
