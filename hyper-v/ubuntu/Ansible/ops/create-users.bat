rem Explorer-double-click launcher for ops/create-users.sh. The .sh is
rem the real entry; this .bat exists so an operator can run the
rem create-users flow without first opening a WSL terminal. The .sh
rem dispatches the Common-Ansible substrate bridge, which re-execs
rem itself into the WSL controller, so launching through Git Bash here
rem is sufficient.
rem
rem _find-bash.bat from Common-Automation locates Git Bash robustly and
rem sets %BASH%; reused rather than reimplemented (the lookup probes
rem several install layouts and has its own rationale comments).
rem Common-Automation is expected as a sibling checkout under the same
rem parent directory as this repo.
rem
rem We hold the window open here with `pause` so Explorer-click users
rem can read the play recap; the .sh itself stays quiet on exit.
